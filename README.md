# LeetCode SQL 50

This repository includes my solutions to the LeetCode **SQL 50** problem set.

The goal of this work is to improve practical SQL querying skills by solving a structured set of problems.
All queries are written and tested using **MySQL**.

Each problem is placed in a separate folder and includes its own explanation and solution.
